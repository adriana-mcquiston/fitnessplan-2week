    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calming Peach and Sage -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a tab-based navigation system to separate the key areas: a 'Welcome' section with critical safety information, the interactive 'Workout Plan', a 'Nutrition Guide', and a 'Progress Tracker'. This structure was chosen to prevent overwhelming the user with a long scrollable page. It allows for focused engagement with each part of the plan—workouts, diet, and progress—by breaking the information into logical, manageable sections. The user flow is guided by the tabs, with the core interaction being the selection of weeks and days within the workout plan to reveal specific exercises, and logging completions on the tracker chart. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The main visualization is a Chart.js bar chart for the 'Progress Tracker'. Goal: Motivate the user by visualizing their journey. Presentation: A bar chart showing planned cardio minutes for each of the 14 days. Interaction: Users can click 'Log Day' buttons, which dynamically changes the color of the corresponding bar on the chart, providing a sense of accomplishment. This method was chosen over a static list because it's more engaging. The workout plan itself is presented as an interactive list, using JS to show/hide daily content, which is a better organizational tool than a long, static document. Nutrition info is organized in a clean two-column layout for readability. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> Use diaphragmatic breathing. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. When you inhale through your nose, only your belly should rise, not your chest. When you exhale, your belly should gently fall. This activates your deep core muscles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Move slowly and with intention. Think about which muscle you should be engaging and feel it working. Good form prevents injury and is more effective than rushing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check for Coning:</strong> "Coning" is a visible ridge or dome shape that forms down the center of your abdomen during an exercise. If you see this, it indicates too much pressure on your core. Stop the exercise immediately and try a modification or a different movement.</li>
